# Crawler.net
Very simple web crawler using automatas
Actually Mails and URLs are implemented (at least, parcially)

## Usage
Clone the repository and use the `dotnet` CLI to run.

Example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdsonReza/Crawler.net.git
cd Crawler.net

dotnet run -- https://google.com/
```

The automatas implementation is in `Classes/Automatas`
